        <h3>History</h3>
         <p>
             Riot Grrrl, a group mainly comprised of white females that identified as 
             “punk-feminists,” emerged in the early 1990s in Washington, D.C.and 
             Olympia, Washington (Downes 2012).The term Riot Grrrl stems from 
             Allison Wolfe and Molly Neuman, members of the feminist punk band 
             Bratmobile, who coined the phrase “girl riot.” Jen Smith then created 
             the term “grrrl” and later “Riot Grrrl” through the expression 
             “angry grrrl zines” devised by Tobi Vail (Downes 2012). 
             Early participants deliberately used “grrrl” instead of “girl” to 
             remove the passive association with the word “girl” as well as to 
             display the anger behind the movement, reminiscent of a growl 
             (Rosenburg 1998 and Schilt 2003). Due to the founding women’s 
             punk roots and use of shock protest, the public viewed Riot 
             Grrrl in a more radical light than other feminist groups 
             (Schilt 2003). The Riot Grrrl movement encouraged females 
             to become more involved in the male-dominated punk scene. 
             In the 1970’s, women were generally only considered “punk” 
             through the association of being a girlfriend of one of the male 
             members of the group. While punk is primarily male-dominated, many 
             women took part in the early punk scene. However, with the advent of 
             “hardcore punk” in the early 1980s, hypermasculinity became the norm 
             and women’s influences declined (Rosenburg 1998). Women began creating 
             their own magazines, fanzines or “zines”, to share ideas that eventually
            led to spreading the movement nationwide. The increasing 
            awareness led to the creation of local Riot Grrrl weekly 
            meeting that eventually turned into national conventions.
